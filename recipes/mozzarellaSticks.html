    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a medium bowl. Blend flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl</li>
        <li>Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan.</li>
        <li>Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack. Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks</li>
        <li>Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels. Repeat to fry remaining mozzarella sticks</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
